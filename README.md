# Static site generator
## Guided by [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev)

This is the project from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) that was designed to make students build a `static site generator` from scratch with a little guidance. Most test cases where just testing whether your tests are throwing error or not, so technically you could pass all of the lessons without actually writing anything. But if you do follow the advices, then you can build something like this, obviously it will be different for every person, since nobody is stopping your from creating your own directories/files/functions/classes with your own names and own content.
The guidance was telling you how you can do it from abstract level, not how you have to do it. That's why my version is drastically different from the version of the author of the course and anybody else who has finished this project.
